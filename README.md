## Project status

Complete. This project exists only to support the [`brag`](https://github.com/mbutterick/brag) library. Probably a lot of the improvements I made could be merged into the main [`parser-tools`](https://github.com/racket/parser-tools) library, but it is old and delicate. Still, if you want to build a dependency into your project, I suggest you use `parser-tools` (because itâ€™s maintained by the Racket team), not this one.
